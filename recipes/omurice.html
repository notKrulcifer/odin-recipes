    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Japanese omurice (オムライス) is a thin, soft-cooked omelette wrapped around seasoned Japanese ketchup rice (ケチャップライス)
        or chicken rice (チキンライス). The name itself is a catchy Japanese loanword that blends “omelette” and “rice.”</p>
    <p>This Western-style dish is unique to Japan, as it doesn’t exist in American or European cuisine. Several
        restaurants in Japan claim to have created omurice in the early 1900s. However, it was in 1925 that a chef in
        Osaka at a Western-style diner called Hokkyokusei created a dish very similar to the omurice that we know and
        love today.</p>
