    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Japanese omurice (オムライス) is a thin, soft-cooked omelette wrapped around seasoned Japanese ketchup rice (ケチャップライス)
        or chicken rice (チキンライス). The name itself is a catchy Japanese loanword that blends “omelette” and “rice.”</p>
    <p>This Western-style dish is unique to Japan, as it doesn’t exist in American or European cuisine. Several
        restaurants in Japan claim to have created omurice in the early 1900s. However, it was in 1925 that a chef in
        Osaka at a Western-style diner called Hokkyokusei created a dish very similar to the omurice that we know and
        love today.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Large eggs</li>
        <li>Cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
        <li>Chicken thigh</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Green peas</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the chicken rice:</strong>
            <p>Stir-fry the chicken and onion, then season them with ketchup. Let the excess moisture evaporate first,
                then add the steamed rice. Toss to combine and set aside.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can make my Rice Cooker Chicken Rice ahead of time and freeze individual portions so
                you can start making an omelette right away!</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the omelette:</strong>
            <p>Beat the eggs and salt and strain them through a fine-mesh strainer. Melt the butter in a frying pan and
                add the egg mixture. Stir the eggs constantly with a pair of chopsticks while you shake the pan to make
                soft, small curds.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the omurice:</strong>
            <p>When the eggs are half-cooked, place the chicken rice in the center of the omelette. Move the pan to a
                wet cloth to cool it. Wrap both sides of the omelette around the rice in an oval shape. Invert the
                omurice onto a plate and fix the shape with a paper towel. Pour the sauce or drizzle a zigzag pattern of
                ketchup onto the omurice.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
