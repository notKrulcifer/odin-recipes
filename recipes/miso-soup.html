    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Miso soup (味噌汁, miso shiru) is a traditional Japanese soup made from a miso paste mixed into dashi (Japanese soup
        stock). It often includes ingredients like tofu, seaweed, green onions, and vegetables, with variations
        depending on the region and season. A staple in Japanese cuisine, miso soup is enjoyed as a side dish with
        meals, offering a comforting umami flavor and numerous health benefits.</p>
