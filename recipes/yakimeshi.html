    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Late-night dinners were a usual event growing up in Tokyo. The energy in the city was like no other—similar to
        New York, it was 24/7. I remember the sweet and savory scents of okonomiyaki and oden perfuming the streets, and
        the laughter and chatter buzzing from the izakayas. But my favorite of course was going to the local ramen shop.
        My mother and I would share the miso ramen, gyoza, and fried rice—always served piping hot. The meal comforted
        me like a warm blanket. Now in my 30s, I look back on those evenings with such nostalgia that when I’m feeling
        homesick or the growing pains of adulthood, I make this fried rice. The properties of chahan, aka yakimeshi, are
        similar to most fried rice recipes—use whatever vegetable and protein on hand. In Japan, the ramen restaurants
        usually served theirs with peas, corn, and chashu (pork belly) trimmings; the trimmings from the perfectly cut
        disks they served in their ramen.</p>
    <p>Each grain is covered in oil and aromatic soy sauce, the vegetables perfectly cooked with bite, you can serve
        this as a main or a side dish with soup or simple salad. The most important thing about making fried rice is the
        preparation of the rice. It should be cold and mostly dried out of its sticky moisture. This ensures the grains
        crumble and not stick to the pan when cooking, and that the grains soak up the sesame oil and soy sauce
        flavoring.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoonneutral oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten to blend
        </li>
        <li>5 ounce41/50 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, cut into ¼-inch pieces, or 3 ounces Japanese Berkshire pork
            sausage</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, finely chopped (about ¾ cup)
        </li>
        <li>2 scallions, finely chopped
        </li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
        </li>
        <li>3 cupcooked short-grain rice or brown rice, chilled
        </li>
        <li>3/4 cupcorn, canned or frozen, thawed
        </li>
        <li>3/4 cuppeas, canned or frozen, thawed
        </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoonwhite pepper
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoontoasted sesame oil
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoonsoy sauce
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Pour in 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil, then add the
            eggs and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 3 minutes, until just cooked through. Transfer the eggs to a
            plate.</li>
        <li>In the same pan over medium-high heat, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons of the neutral oil. Once the oil is
            hot and glistening, cook the shrimp, carrots, scallions, and garlic, stirring, for about 2 minutes, until
            the carrots are darker in color and softened.</li>
        <li>Add the rice, stirring and cutting through the rice, mixing with the carrot and shrimp mixture, and coating
            the rice in the seasoned oil, for about 1 minute, until warmed through. Mix in the corn, peas, and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Push the rice off to the side of the frying pan and pour the sesame oil into the empty side. Once the oil is
            hot, stir the rice mixture into the oil.</li>
        <li>Push the rice off to the side again and pour the soy sauce into the empty side, making sure the soy sauce is
            sizzling before mixing and incorporating into the rice. Stir in the reserved eggs until combined, then serve
            immediately.</li>
    </ol>
