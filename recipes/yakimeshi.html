    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Late-night dinners were a usual event growing up in Tokyo. The energy in the city was like no other—similar to
        New York, it was 24/7. I remember the sweet and savory scents of okonomiyaki and oden perfuming the streets, and
        the laughter and chatter buzzing from the izakayas. But my favorite of course was going to the local ramen shop.
        My mother and I would share the miso ramen, gyoza, and fried rice—always served piping hot. The meal comforted
        me like a warm blanket. Now in my 30s, I look back on those evenings with such nostalgia that when I’m feeling
        homesick or the growing pains of adulthood, I make this fried rice. The properties of chahan, aka yakimeshi, are
        similar to most fried rice recipes—use whatever vegetable and protein on hand. In Japan, the ramen restaurants
        usually served theirs with peas, corn, and chashu (pork belly) trimmings; the trimmings from the perfectly cut
        disks they served in their ramen.</p>
    <p>Each grain is covered in oil and aromatic soy sauce, the vegetables perfectly cooked with bite, you can serve
        this as a main or a side dish with soup or simple salad. The most important thing about making fried rice is the
        preparation of the rice. It should be cold and mostly dried out of its sticky moisture. This ensures the grains
        crumble and not stick to the pan when cooking, and that the grains soak up the sesame oil and soy sauce
        flavoring.</p>
